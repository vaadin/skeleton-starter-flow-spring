# Project Base for Vaadin Flow and Spring Boot

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own Vaadin Flow application with Spring Boot.
It contains all the necessary configuration and some placeholder files to get you started.

The best way to create your own project based on this starter is [start.vaadin.com](https://start.vaadin.com/) - you can get only the necessary parts and choose the package naming you want to use.

Import the project to the IDE of your choosing as a Maven project.

Run the application using `mvn spring-boot:run` or by running the `Application` class directly from your IDE.

Open http://localhost:8080/ in a browser.

If you want to run the application locally in the production mode, run `mvn spring-boot:run -Pproduction`.
